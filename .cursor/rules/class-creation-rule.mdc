# Class Creation Rule

## Process Guidelines
- Clearly explain the purpose of each class before implementation
- Explain how the class fits into the overall architecture
- Pause for feedback or go-ahead before continuing to next class
- Wait for explicit approval before implementing multiple related classes

## Implementation Approach
- Start with minimal interface and core functionality
- Implement only what's necessary for current requirements
- Focus on clear domain representation without overengineering
- Consider how the class will be tested
