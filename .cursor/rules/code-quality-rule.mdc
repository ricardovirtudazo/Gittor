# Code Quality Rule

## Minimalist Design

- **YAGNI**: Don't implement features until needed
    - Avoid speculative generalization
    - Remove unused code and "future-proofing"
- **DRY**: Avoid duplication without premature abstraction
    - Consolidate duplicate logic but don't over-abstract
    - Create shared utilities only after repeated patterns emerge
- **Explicit Over Implicit**: Prefer readable code over clever code
    - Avoid magic strings/numbers
    - Write self-documenting code with descriptive names
    - Use comments only for "why" not "what" (code should explain what it does)

## Naming Conventions

- Use clear, descriptive names that reveal intent
    - PascalCase for classes, methods, properties
    - camelCase for parameters and local variables
    - Prefix interfaces with 'I'
    - Suffix async methods with 'Async'
    - Avoid abbreviations except for standard ones (ID, HTTP, etc.)
    - Use positive phrasing (e.g., `isCorrect` instead of `isNotCorrect` or `isFalse`)

## Organization

- Organize code by feature, not technical concerns
- Namespace should match folder structure
- Keep implementation details hidden from API boundaries
- Maintain consistency in file structure across similar components

## Complexity Control

- Keep code straightforward with manageable complexity
    - Avoid deeply nested conditionals
    - Extract complex conditions to well-named methods
    - Favor early returns over nested conditions
